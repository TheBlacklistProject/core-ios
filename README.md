# About the project

This application is pretended to be used as a tool which permits manage all your loans, giving you the opportunity to don't 
worry about memorizing who is in debt with you, how much money did you lend and how much money would you win after the loan finishes.

In order to make the best of this project, we have searched about different software design patterns like _MVC_, _VIPER_, _MVVM_ and we've chosen the combining between _MVP_ and _Clean architecture_. Please find below a short meaningful description about each one.

## Architecture

### MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

**Model:**
Contains all the logic of the bussines

**View:**
It is passive and is in charge of display the data to the user and receive all the user interactions.

**Presenter:** 
It is the connector between the model and the view. It handles all the user interactions and converts the data retrieved from the model to friendly human readable format.

### Clean architecture

# About us

We are fascinated iOS and software developers, enjoy converting a cup of ☕️ in hundred lines of code. We met in our actual job and decided to start developing open source applications wishing someday the community can contribute in our projects and help us making a "common" application into a big one with the best coding practices and using a clean architecture.
